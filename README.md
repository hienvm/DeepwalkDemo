# Group Project: Graph Algorithms and Its application - Group 14

In this project, we learned and implemented an approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network, which encode social relations in a vector space and from that we can exploit it using statistical models.

# DeepWalk
DeepWalk uses short random walks to learn representations for vertices in graphs.

# Evaluation
Here, we evalutate DeepWalk on the BlogCatalog dataset 

# Requirements
- numpy
- pytorch
- pandas
- networkx
- scikit-learn
